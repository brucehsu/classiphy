 * \anchor faq-GPL Q. Is it possible to release an LGPL version of the
 * QuaZip?
 *
 * A. I do not know much about licensing, so I can answer for sure, but
 * QuaZip was developed using Open Source edition of Qt, so I see no
 * way it could be released under anything except GPL.
 *
 * \anchor faq-non-QIODevice Q. Is there any way to use QuaZipFile in Qt
 * where you are supposed to use normal (non-zipped) file, but not
 * through QIODevice API?
 *
 * A. Usually not. For example, if you are passing file name to some
 * database driver (like SQLite), Qt usually just passes this name down
 * to the 3rd-party library, which is usually does not know anything
 * about QIODevice and therefore there is no way to pass QuaZipFile as
 * normal file. However, if we are talking about some place where you
 * pass file name, and then indirectly use QFile to open it, then it is
 * a good idea to make overloaded method, which accepts QIODevice
 * pointer. Then you would be able to pass QuaZipFile as well as many
 * other nice things such as QBuffer or QProcess.
