<h1><a class="anchor" name="faq"><a class="el" href="classQuaZip.html" title="ZIP archive.">QuaZip</a> FAQ </a></h1><a class="anchor" name="faq-GPL"></a> Q. Is it possible to release an LGPL version of the <a class="el" href="classQuaZip.html" title="ZIP archive.">QuaZip</a>?<p>
A. I do not know much about licensing, so I can answer for sure, but <a class="el" href="classQuaZip.html" title="ZIP archive.">QuaZip</a> was developed using Open Source edition of Qt, so I see no way it could be released under anything except GPL.<p>
<a class="anchor" name="faq-non-QIODevice"></a> Q. Is there any way to use <a class="el" href="classQuaZipFile.html" title="A file inside ZIP archive.">QuaZipFile</a> in Qt where you are supposed to use normal (non-zipped) file, but not through QIODevice API?<p>
A. Usually not. For example, if you are passing file name to some database driver (like SQLite), Qt usually just passes this name down to the 3rd-party library, which is usually does not know anything about QIODevice and therefore there is no way to pass <a class="el" href="classQuaZipFile.html" title="A file inside ZIP archive.">QuaZipFile</a> as normal file. However, if we are talking about some place where you pass file name, and then indirectly use QFile to open it, then it is a good idea to make overloaded method, which accepts QIODevice pointer. Then you would be able to pass <a class="el" href="classQuaZipFile.html" title="A file inside ZIP archive.">QuaZipFile</a> as well as many other nice things such as QBuffer or QProcess. </div>
