 Q. Is it possible to release an LGPL version of the \doxyref{QuaZip}{p.}{classQuaZip}?

A. I do not know much about licensing, so I can answer for sure, but \doxyref{QuaZip}{p.}{classQuaZip} was developed using Open Source edition of Qt, so I see no way it could be released under anything except GPL.

 Q. Is there any way to use \doxyref{QuaZipFile}{p.}{classQuaZipFile} in Qt where you are supposed to use normal (non-zipped) file, but not through QIODevice API?

A. Usually not. For example, if you are passing file name to some database driver (like SQLite), Qt usually just passes this name down to the 3rd-party library, which is usually does not know anything about QIODevice and therefore there is no way to pass \doxyref{QuaZipFile}{p.}{classQuaZipFile} as normal file. However, if we are talking about some place where you pass file name, and then indirectly use QFile to open it, then it is a good idea to make overloaded method, which accepts QIODevice pointer. Then you would be able to pass \doxyref{QuaZipFile}{p.}{classQuaZipFile} as well as many other nice things such as QBuffer or QProcess.
